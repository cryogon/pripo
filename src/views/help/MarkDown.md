# Markdown Syntax Guide

## Headers

Headers are used to create titles or section headings. To create a header, add one or more hash symbols (#) at the beginning of the line followed by a space and the header text. The number of hash symbols indicates the level of the header.

Example:
```
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
```

## Emphasis

You can emphasize text in several ways using Markdown syntax:

### Bold

To make text bold, surround it with two asterisks (**).

Example:
```
**This text will be bold**
```

### Italic

To make text italic, surround it with one asterisk (*).

Example:
```
*This text will be italic*
```

### Bold and Italic

To make text bold and italic, surround it with three asterisks (***).

Example:
```
***This text will be bold and italic***
```

## Lists

Markdown supports ordered and unordered lists.

### Unordered Lists

To create an unordered list, start each line with an asterisk (*), plus (+), or minus (-), followed by a space and the list item.

Example:
```
* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3
```

### Ordered Lists

To create an ordered list, start each line with a number followed by a period (.) and a space, then the list item.

Example:
```
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
```

## Links

To create a link, use the following syntax: `[link text](link URL)`.

Example:
```
[Google](https://www.google.com/)
```

## Images

To add an image, use the following syntax: `![alt text](image URL)`.

Example:
```
![Alt Text](https://example.com/image.jpg)
```

## Code Blocks

To display code blocks, indent each line of the block by four spaces or one tab. You can also use triple backticks (\`\`\`) to create a code block.

Example:
```
    if (true) {
        console.log("Hello, World!");
    }
```

## Horizontal Rule

To create a horizontal rule, use three or more hyphens, asterisks, or underscores on a new line.

Example:
```
---
```

## Blockquotes

To create a blockquote, use the greater than sign (>) at the beginning of the line followed by a space and the quote.

Example:
```
> This is a blockquote.
```

## Tables

To create a table, use pipes (|) to separate columns and hyphens (-) to separate the header row from the content rows.

Example:
```
| Header 1 | Header 2 |
| -------- | -------- |
| Content 1 | Content 2 |
```

That's it! These are the most commonly used Markdown syntax. You can use these elements to format your text and create visually appealing content for your website.
